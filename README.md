Python 3.5 code to collect data on all DFM stocks.

IN ORDER TO USE THE PROGRAM, YOU ONLY NEED TO RUN DFM2.py.
DEPENDENCIES INCLUDE PANDAS, NUMPY, MATPLOTLIB, SELENIUM AND BS4. YOU ALSO NEED A WEBBROWSER WITH SOMETHING LIKE CHROMEDRIVER.
Everything else is just my poorly coded demonstration of how to use the data.

This program scrapes the DFM website to collect historical data (6-month) of shares listed on UAE's Dubai Financial Market. This is difficult to do by hand because there is a need to press several buttons to obtain each CSV and so a headed browser is required (Is it?).
So a dependancy would be something like chrome's chromedriver etc. which you would need to place in the file where you keep the scripts.

All of the attached files that are not Python scripts, like download (#).csv files and images are simply there to show what you can do with the program. The CSV files are the main output of the program, containing daily close prices of all the listed equities.
